# Overview

This project is a simple command-line calculator application developed in C++ to help strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts in the language. The purpose of this software is to demonstrate my ability to implement basic arithmetic operations using C++ syntax, functions, conditionals, loops, and error handling.

By building this calculator, I aimed to deepen my experience with input validation, exception handling using try and catch, and working with user input via standard input/output streams. This exercise also helped me practice modular programming by organizing my code into reusable functions.

# Development Environment

IDE: Visual Studio Community 2022

Language: C++

Compiler: Microsoft C++ (MSVC)

OS: Windows 10

No external libraries were used; the project uses only the standard C++ library for input/output and string manipulation.

# Future Work

- Add support for more advanced operations (exponents, modulus, square roots).

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) version using a framework like Qt or SFML.

- Add unit tests to automatically validate correctness of operations.

- Improve user experience with better input prompts and error messages
